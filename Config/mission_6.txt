Government Official: Moot Sile, captain of Sonatu! By order of the First Lords of the Admiralty, you are to be tried for conspiracy to overthrow the First Lords, for high treason against the nation of Valtameri, and for aggression on the high seas!
Moot: <Eyes widen with shock and confusion>
Government Official: You are to surrender and cooperate fully. Your cooperation will grant you leniency during trial; however, your lack thereof will be promptly and severely punished. You have 10 minutes to declare your surrender.
Ivan: Bull. A trial is as good as a death warrant.
Farthing: How could they? We freaking killed the sea monster queen! We even told them about the crimes of P.I.R.A.T.E.S! This is false incrimination!
Checkers: The First Lords clearly have no place in their hearts for us.
Ivan: It's convenient. They declare us enemies, and take credit for saving the citizens from the sea monsters. A disgustingly smart political move.
Farthing: Captain, we will fight with you till the end!
Checkers: Hey, before we go down in flames, I gotta ask. Can you really not talk?
Moot: <Nods head>
Government Official: Your time is up. Men, send them to the bottom of the ocean!
Ivan: Like hell you will!
Moot: <Swings his sword and signals to charge>
