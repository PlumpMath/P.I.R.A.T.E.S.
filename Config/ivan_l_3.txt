Ivan: Cap', did you see today's headline about the tiny psychic that escaped from jail? It read "Small Medium at Large."
Moot: <Snorts and starts laughing>
Ivan: You know, after the old Cap' passed on, you're the only one that laughs at my jokes. I guess my face just doesn't lend itself well to comedy. Have I ever told you about why I started telling jokes?
Moot: <Shakes head>
Ivan: It was a few years after I joined P.I.R.A.T.E.S. I was working in a rather crazy crew. These guys would laugh at absolutely anything. Especially the captain. My God, he told the worst jokes. And every time he told one, everyone would just fall out laughing.
Moot: <...>
Ivan: I kept yelling at him that he should be more serious on the ocean. "If you don't stop joking around, you're gonna get you and your crew killed," I would constantly say. Well, I finally regretted those words.
Moot: <...>
Ivan: For one mission, those bastards didn't crack a single joke. It was the most miserably boring time of my entire life. Everyone was absolutely stone faced. After the mission, I begged the captain to start telling jokes again. He grinned and said, "Only if you tell some." Ever since then, jokes have been a big part of my life.
