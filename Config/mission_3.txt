Ivan: Checkers! What's the time?
Checkers: A good deal past three, sir!
Moot: <Stamps his foot and  glares at Ivan>
Ivan: It's a good bet that they're not coming, sir. What are your orders?
Moot: <Stares at the approaching monsters for a few moments, then points toward them>
Farthing: Oh, come on! We're going to fight these things alone?!
Ivan: Cap', for once, Farthing may not be wrong to be scared. We don't know what that queen is capable of.
Moot: <Glances at each member of his crew, walks to the bow of the ship, and draws his sword>
Ivan: A single ship against a monster queen and her spawn? This is like a bad joke.
Checkers: You'd certainly know.
Farthing: Even though we're sure to die... Aye, Captain!
