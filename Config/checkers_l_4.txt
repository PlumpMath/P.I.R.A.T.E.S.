Checkers: Captain? Next time we come back to port, would you play me in a game of checkers?
Moot: <Raises an eyebrow>
Checkers: I know it seems like an odd request with all that's going on, but it's while playing checkers that I feel like I'm actually in control of something. Everything makes sense. It's all black and white. Or black and red, depending on the board.
Moot: <...>
Checkers: Also, I think you'd make a pretty good opponent. Mind you, I'll definitely win, but I'm sure your aggressive nature will cause me to sweat a few times.
Moot: <Grins and nods>
Checkers: Thanks, Captain! I'm looking forward to it!
