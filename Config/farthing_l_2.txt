Farthing: You know, my father made me join P.I.R.A.T.E.S.
Moot: <Tilts head slightly to the right side>
Farthing: I remember exactly what he said.
Moot: <Waves Farthing on>
Farthing: "Son, you need to pucker up. Hike up your panties and join P.I.R.A.T.E.S. Maybe we can make a man out of you!"
Moot: <Snorts>
Farthing: ...
Moot: <Starts laughing>
Farthing: Captain... am I at least good at what I do?
Moot: <Nods>
Farthing: I mean if I'm not... You can just tell me.
Moot: <Closes his eyes and nods again, this time slower>
Farthing: Ha! That'll show my father. I'm glad I joined P.I.R.A.T.E.S.
Moot: <Pats Farthing on the shoulder and leaves>
