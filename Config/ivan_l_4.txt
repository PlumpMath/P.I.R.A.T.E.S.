Ivan: Hey, you know the history of P.I.R.A.T.E.S., right? How they were founded?
Moot: <Nods>
Ivan: Well, do you know who the very first members of P.I.R.A.T.E.S were?
Moot: <Shakes head>
Ivan: Believe it or not, the first members were a few guys that had a few too many drinks.
Moot: <Raises his eyebrows>
Ivan: I know this because my grandfather was one of those men. He and his buddies were knocking back a few cups of grog and complaining loudly about the epidemic of bandits and the uselessness of the First Lords. One of the other patrons shouted over to them, 'Hey, maybe you guys should show the government how it's done!' Of course, it was just a joke, but my grandpa suddenly got a serious look on his face and looked at his friends. After a moment, he said, 'Y'know, that bastard over there may have a damn good point.'
Moot: <...>
Ivan: Before anyone could talk some sense into them, the men had jumped into my grandpa's sloop, armed themselves with a few rifles and swords that were stashed there, and sailed straight at the nearest bandit ship. And you know what? Those bandits were so intimidated by their drunken charge, they actually jumped overboard without a shot being fired! When my grandpa boarded their abandoned ship, he stumbled up to the bow and shouted at the bandits in the water, 'Hey! Peace Is Really Awesome! Therefore Eat-' Um, I'd rather not say what the last word is, but suffice to say that that phrase gave P.I.R.A.T.E.S. its name.
Moot: <Laughs and gives Ivan a thumbs up>
Ivan: Thanks, Moot. Even if the organization isn't what is was, I'll always be proud to call myself a member of P.I.R.A.T.E.S.
