Checkers: What do you do for fun, Captain?
Moot: <Thinks for a few seconds, then mimes firing a bow and arrow>
Checkers: Archery? Wow, I'd have never guessed. Are you good?
Moot: <Smirks and nods>
Checkers: I always assumed your hobby was miming. That'd explain why you never talk.
Moot: <Face-palms, points to his own mouth, and then shakes his head>
Checkers: Nuh-uh, Captain. You might have the rest fooled, but I know this "muteness" is just a charade.
Moot: <Crosses his arms and growls>
