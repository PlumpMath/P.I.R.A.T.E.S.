Government Official: Well if it isn't Moot Sile, captain of Sonatu. How can I help you?
Ivan: Concerning P.I.R.A.T.E.S.-
Government Official: Was I talking to you?
Ivan: That doesn't-
Moot: <Places hand on Ivan's back>
Ivan: Aye, sorry Cap'.
Government Official: As I was saying, what can I do for a P.I.R.A.T.E.S. member?
Moot: <Hands the government official a piece of paper>
Government Official: Why don't you tell me what you want, kid? You are wasting my time.
Ivan: He's a mute, dammit!
Farthing: Wait... really?
Moot: <Nods>
Farthing: Wow. I just figured you were acting all 'strong and silent.'
Government Official: *clears throat* In any case... *Reads the note*
Checkers: Well...?
Government Official: By the Gods, this is absurd! And you want reinforcements too?
Moot: <Nods>
Government Official: Why would the government help P.I.R.A.T.E.S. after what you've just shown me?
Ivan: We didn't release those monsters, sir. We came clean as soon as we learned this. We thought the government would be more appreciative.
Government Official: I suppose you aren't at fault here...
Checkers: No, we aren't. Actually, I bet if you tracked the fault back far enough, I bet you'll find the Deep-Sea Don's grubby little hand in the metaphorical cookie jar...
Government Official: Shut your mouth or I'll cut your tongue out.
Checkers: ...
Government Official: I'll see what I can do, Moot. I'll let the First Lords of the Admiralty know, but to me, this looks like a fair deal. The reinforcements will meet you right outside of Philips' Cave at 2:00PM sharp, like you requested.
Moot: <Nods head and then proceeds to shake hands with the official>
