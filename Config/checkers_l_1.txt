Checkers: Care for a game of checkers, Captain?
Moot: <Shakes head>
Checkers: Yeah, I figured you’d be pretty busy with your new duties. Must be difficult to captain a crew like this.
Moot: <Shrugs>
Checkers: You’ve gotta keep your eye on them, too. In fact, I’ve begun to suspect that Ivan is actually working with the government.
Moot: <Rolls eyes>
Checkers: But it’s obvious!
Moot: <Points at his own hat>
Checkers: Ok, so I was wrong about you raising birds under there, but at the time, it seemed so obvious!
Moot: <Stares pointedly>
Checkers: This is different.
Moot: <Shakes head and sighs>
