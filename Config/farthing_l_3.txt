Farthing: ...
Moot: <Nudges Farthing>
Farthing: Oh! I'm sorry Captain! I was just lost in a minute of thought!
Moot: <Smiles>
Farthing: You know, when I was a kid my father used to play with me a lot.
Moot: <...>
Farthing: He'd always play with me a little before dinner and then he'd tuck me into bed. One day, we played this game called "Scare Me Not". It was a simple game, first person to get scared loses. My father tried everything to scare me. Nothing worked!
Moot: <Raises both eyebrows in disbelief>
Farthing: One day my father took an octopus costume and put it on his head. It looked like the tentacles were coming out of his mouth. I still wasn't scared!
Moot: <...>
Farthing: That is... until my dad put the octopus costume in my closet. I woke up in the middle of the night cold. I went to my closet to put on a sweater. When I opened the closet, the octopus costume fell on me. I screamed. Ever since then, I just haven't been as brave as I was. I just jump at the slightest things!
Moot: <Pats Farthing on the shoulder>
Farthing: It really sucks sometimes. I feel like people lose respect for me because of it.
Moot: <Shakes head>
Farthing: You mean, you haven't lost respect for me?
Moot: <Shakes head emphatically>
Farthing: Thanks Cap... OH GOD! A WASP!
Moot: <Stares blankly>
Farthing: <Turns pale>
Moot: <Crushes the wasp with his hands>
Farthing: Phew.. Thanks Captain!
Ivan: Hey Cap'! Quit being a buzz-kill!
