Checkers: Captain! Got a minute?
Moot: <Nods>
Checkers: Great! I was just thinking about that fight with the smugglers. I think we could have performed a little better. Here, I jotted down some of my observations.
Moot: <Takes the notes and begins to read. Raises eyebrows and looks impressed>
Checkers: ...well?
Moot: <Nods and pats Checkers on the shoulder>
Checkers: Thanks, Captain! I'll let you know if I notice anything else. Oh! On that note, I think I saw Farthing communicating with the sea itself! You think he's some kind of Sea Spirit?
Moot: <Sighs and shakes head>
