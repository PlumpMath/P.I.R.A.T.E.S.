Farthing: Captain, I just wanted to say...
Moot: <Raises right eyebrow>
Farthing: I admire your bravery.
Moot: <Smiles>
Farthing: I've never respected a Captain as much as you.
Moot: <Smiles wider>
Farthing: You deserve a better helmsman than me.
Moot: <Concerned look>
Farthing: I feel like I'd been nothing but a hindrance, during our missions.
Moot: <Shakes head>
Farthing: Well... thanks Captain!
Moot: <Nods once>
Farthing: I don't think the crew likes me. Ivan is always coming up with new ways to scare me. He keeps telling me to suck it up.
Moot: <...>
Farthing: Checkers keeps talking about how I'm from the sea and I'm some sort of spirit. It's beginning to scare me.
Moot: <...>
Farthing: You are the only one I can rely on, Captain!
Moot: <Gives Farthing a pat on the back>
Checkers: Captain, get away from the sea spirit. He'll drag you down to the depths of the ocean and drown you!
Farthing: SEA SPIRIT? WHERE?!?!?
Moot: <Stares at Checkers>
Farthing: <Shivers>
Moot: <Turns around and smacks Checkers across the head>
Checkers: Ow! Fine... Farthing... there's no sea spirits.
Farthing: Phew!
Checkers: *Mumbles under his breath* Except you.
Moot: <Smacks Checkers on the back of the head again>
