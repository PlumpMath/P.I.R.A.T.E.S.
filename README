This is the P.I.R.A.T.E.S. readme file

P.I.R.A.T.E.S. is a small turn based strategy video game created by 4 University of Florida students as a school project for the class Theory and Practice of Multimedia Production, CAP 3020. P.I.R.A.T.E.S. holds a special place in all of our hearts and all of us list it as one of, if not, our best and most enlightening experience at the University of Florida.

P.I.R.A.T.E.S. uses Panda3D and Python to make itself work. Feel free to read our code to brush up on Python or see how we did certain things in Panda3D.
